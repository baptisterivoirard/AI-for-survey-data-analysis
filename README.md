# AI for Survey Data Analysis  

This repository contains a project conducted for the **Machine Learning** class during my second year of a Master's in Bioinformatics. The objective was to analyze and model mental health survey data using a variety of **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms**.  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview  
The project was based on the **Mental Health in Tech Survey** dataset, available on Kaggle. This dataset, collected in 2014, explores mental health issues among professionals in the tech industry.  

## ðŸ›  Data Preprocessing & Challenges  
Since the dataset was derived from survey responses, it presented **significant challenges in terms of data quality**. The initial dataset contained:  
- **Missing values** requiring imputation techniques.  
- **Inconsistent categorical variables** that needed proper encoding.  
- **Redundant or irrelevant features** that required thorough feature selection.  

Extensive data preprocessing was performed to **clean, standardize, and engineer** new features, ensuring that the dataset was suitable for ML applications.  

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & Deep Learning Approaches  
A wide range of **ML and DL algorithms** were applied to predict whether an individual in the tech industry is likely to require mental health treatment. A comparative analysis of their performance was conducted. The methods included:  

### âœ… **Machine Learning Models:**  
- **Logistic Regression** â€“ Baseline binary classification model.  
- **Decision Trees & Random Forest** â€“ Improved interpretability and feature importance insights.  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** â€“ Handling complex decision boundaries.  
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)** â€“ High-performance ensemble methods.  

### ðŸ§  **Deep Learning Models:**  
- **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)** â€“ Fully connected feedforward neural networks.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Evaluation & Model Comparison  
To assess the effectiveness of each model, the following metrics were analyzed:  
âœ” **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score** â€“ Standard classification metrics.  
âœ” **ROC-AUC Curve** â€“ Evaluating model discrimination power.  
âœ” **Confusion Matrices** â€“ Understanding false positives & false negatives.  
âœ” **Feature Importance Analysis** â€“ Performed on the best-performing model for interpretability.  

## ðŸ”¬ Key Findings  
- Extensive data cleaning **significantly improved model performance**.  
- **Boosted ensemble methods** (Random Forest, XGBoost) provided strong results.  
- Feature importance analysis revealed key workplace factors influencing mental health predictions.
